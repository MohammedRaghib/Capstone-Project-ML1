# Movie Rating Prediction

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts a movie's rating based on its metadata. Many platforms and production companies use such predictions to assess the potential success of a movie before release. By analyzing features such as budget, genres, runtime, release date, and popularity, this project aims to forecast a movie's rating (e.g., vote average) and provide insights into which factors most influence audience reception.

## Overview
This project predicts movie ratings using metadata from the TMDb 5000 Movie Dataset.  
It demonstrates fundamental Machine Learning concepts including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [TMDb 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
- Features include:
  - Budget
  - Genres
  - Runtime
  - Release date
  - Popularity
  - Vote average (target variable)

## Steps Implemented
1. Data Exploration (EDA)
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
5. Model Evaluation (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²)
6. Insights and Visualizations
